Thanks for reviewing the final project.To navigate, there are 8 data manipulate functionalities within the pages. 

DATA MANIPULATION FUNCTIONS: 

I'm listing them down to help you review each of them. Maybe you want to open this readme.txt in a new tab. 

1. when you go to ~/Final.html page, you have to SIGN UP, this function create a regular user in zzhenyanglu.users table.

2. after creating a regular user, you will be redirected to ~/SemiFinal.html, where you could click "profile" under User section and UPGRADE TO PREMIUM USER.

3. In the same "profile" page, you could also CHANGE PAYMENT PROFILE (use another credit card for payment). 

4. Also in the same "profile" page, you could RESET PASSWORD.

5. If you go back(by navigation button of your broswer) to ~/SemiFinal page, you could see your own playlists by clicking playlists under User section. You  could not only see all playlists you have created but also CREATE NEW PLAYLIST by entering a playlist name (try inputting a duplicate playlist name). 

6. Then go to ~/SemiFinal, in section FakeSpotify, you could browse musics by click one of "Artist", "Albums", "Public playlists" and "Top Hits". click one of them, and go all the way until you see a music player shown up. This is the music playing page, where you can favorite a song by click "LIKE IT". 

7. In the same page, you can also ADD A SONG TO A PLAYLIST of your own (if you don't remember any of your playlists, the music playing page has that information down there) . 

8. You could also DELETE THE CURRENT SONG FROM A PLAYLIST of your own (if you don't remember any of your playlists, the music playing page has that information down there) . 


I have tried my best to make notes on what procedure is related to each page, please read the NOTICE message on each page. Also, if you need to review table schema and other info, take a look at "Database related information" setion on ~/SemiFinal.html page. 


Try to play a music! 

thanks for your help!
