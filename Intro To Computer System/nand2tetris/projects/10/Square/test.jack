/**
 * Implements the Square Dance game.
 * This simple game allows the user to move a black square around
 * the screen, and change the square's size during the movement.
 * When the game starts, a square of 30 by 30 pixels is shown at the
 * top-left corner of the screen. The user controls the square as follows.
 * The 4 arrow keys are used to move the square up, down, left, and right.
 * The 'z' and 'x' keys are used, respectively, to decrement and increment
 * the square's size. The 'q' key is used to quit the game.
