The exploratory data analysis may suggest a model that is adequate for fitting the data. Do the data show a nonlinear relationship so that a data transform is needed?

Did you check for collinearity among the independent variables?

Did you use a variable selection procedure? If so, describe it.

If several models appear equally good for predicting the data, discuss them all, including, perhaps, an intuitive choice of the model that makes the most sense.

Analyze the residual plots. This might indicate failures in the assumptions or inadequacies in the model

Check for leverage points, influential points, and outliers in your dataset. Decide if they should be deleted or if the model needs to be modified to account for them.

Can your model be improved? Are you satisfied with the model you selected?

Use your selected model to examine the relationships among the variables. Identify the strongest predictors among the independent variables?

Apply cross-validation techniques to evaluate how well your model does for prediction.
