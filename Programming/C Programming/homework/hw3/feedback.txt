Good
  * Interesting algorithm with recursive palindrome algorithm

What cost points
  * Ex1 - Correct implementaion of swap                        : ERROR
  * Ex3 - Properly skips special characters                    : ERROR
  * "Ex3 - main driver, empty string quits, reads from keyboard,
    outputs requested text                                      : PARTIAL"
  * "Ex4 - pickword: skips words with special characters,
    lowercases, picks random word from file                     : PARTIAL"

Observations/Things to Improve
  * *DO-NOT* include .c files in other .c files. Only include .h files
  * ex3 - Homework said "Do not write anything else to the screen"
  * ex3 - The main program should only quit if an empty line or a line
    containing only special characters is entered    
  * You hard coded the value for the number of words in the
    file. While this is the correct way to pick a random number in a
    given range. However, for the purposes of this homework, you are
    to assume that the dictionary file can be arbitrary and the
    number of words in it are not known beforehand. Check 'reservoir
    sampling'

Remarks
  * Please try attend TA hours if possible. We have discussed file
    inclusions, object files, compiling and building. Please ask
    questions if you do not follow.
