/* QUESTION 8 */
/* ANSWER: replacement in a string is not feasible, please see the following example */


#define world class 
printf("hello, world!\n");

/* EXPLANATION: If you preprocess these two lines, you will still get "hello,world" Preprocessor will skip String literal, INSTEAD you could replace it by the following way */

#define name "class"
printf("hello, "name);
