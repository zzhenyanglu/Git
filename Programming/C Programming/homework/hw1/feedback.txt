Good
  * Use of separate function with a prototype at the top.
  * returning "char *" demonstrates understanding of return types
  * detailed comments and demonstration of preprocessor features

Observations/Things to Improve
  * When you display one token next to another it does not manipulate
    inside a string

Remarks
  * Good work
