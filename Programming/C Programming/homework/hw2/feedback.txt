Good
  * Great use of ASCII encodings in part I. Intelligent design.
  * Well documented and explained code.
  * Very good scrambler that efficiently uses stack space.
  * Good use of phony target and dependencies in make.

Observations/Things to Improve
  * Do not use magic ASCII number like 32 or 10 in code. Not reader friendly.
  * The for loop in scramble.c is pretty awkward. Try a while loop instead.
  * Your scramble output.txt has 2048 at the end, while the output on my machine
    has an extra blank line instead of 2048.
    I grade it based on my output here and do not penalize it for now.

Remarks
  * Great job.
