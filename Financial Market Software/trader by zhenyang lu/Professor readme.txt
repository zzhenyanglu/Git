Dear Mark, 

This is Zhenyang Lu. Basically I create most of the coding part of this file. Chuan Niu, our coder, helped me a lot with almost everything.  


It turned out that our team didnot use this version because I am a entry-level C# coder and there is still XML problem inside this code, which I could not even be able to solve.Anyway, this is the part of coding I did. Thank you for your consideration. 

Thank you very much for this course! Actually I suffered it very much!


Best,

Zhenyang
