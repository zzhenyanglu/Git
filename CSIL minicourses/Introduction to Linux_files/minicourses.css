Heading Styles
==============

Here are the suggestions given at the Purdue Online Writing Lab (Clements et al. 2011),

Level 1 Headings --- Centered, Boldface or Italic Type, Headline-style Capitalization
Level 2 Headings --- Centered, Regular Type, Headline-style Capitalization
Level 3 Headings --- Flush Left, Boldface or Italix Type, Headline-style Capitalization
Level 4 Headings --- Flush left, roman type, sentence-style capitalizatoin

If you are using more than 4 layers of headings, you are doing something wrong.
That kind of complexity doesn't belong in a mini course.

I use bold type instead of italic type because, according to Matthew Butterick,

	If you're using a sans serif font, skip italic and use bold for emphasis.
	It's not usually worth italicizing sans serif fonts---unlike serif fonts,
	which look quite different when italicized, most sans serif italic fonts
	just have a gentle slan that doesn't stand out on the page.
	(Butterick)

Paragraphs
==========

I justify the paragraphs because "[c]ompared to left-aligned text, justification gives text a cleaner, more formal look." (Butterick "justified text")
Butterick suggests that "a first-line indent should be no smaller than the point size of the text . . . [and] no bigger than four times the point size." (Butterick "first-line indents")
I have arbitrarily chosen to use two ems of space for indents.
The first paragraph following a heading is not indented because,

	The function of a paragraph indent is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it.
	If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.
	(MetaFilter)

I have set margin-top and margin-bottom to 0 so that there is no space between paragraphs.
I have turned on hyphenation because "in justified text, hyphenation is mandatory." (Butterick "hyphenation")
Hyphenation is set to manual, so you need to supply your own suggested line breaks.
See the link below for more information.

/*
The Body
========

I have arbitrarily chosen to make the body font Arial.
The sans-serif font gives the document a sleeker look, in my opinion.
Buttericks says "[i]n print, the optimal point size for body text is 10--12 point. On the web, the optimal size is 15--25 pixels." (Butterick "point size")
I have not chosen to use pixels, but I picked an arbitrary size of 18pt.
Butterick suggests aiming "for an average line length of 45--90 characters." (Butterick "line length")
I have arbitrarily chosen a line length of 80 characters, which is within that range.
I have margin set to auto, so that the left and the right margins are equal.

/*
Code Blocks
===========

We set white-space to pre-wrap and word-wrap to break-word, because this fixes a display issue where code blocks run out of bounds horizontally.
I have arbitrarily set the font-family as Courier for code blocks.
I recommend using a monospaced font, because that's how people usually see code displayed.

    white-space: pre-wrap;
    word-wrap: break-word;

	font-family: Courier, monospace;

/*
Figures & Captions
==================

I have arbitrarily chosen to center images and their captions.
I have also added an em of space above and below the figure to help differentiate it from the surrounding content.
Because paragraphs are set by default to indent, I have explicitly set no indent for the caption text.
