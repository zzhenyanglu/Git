Hi Bryce/Andrew, 

This homework is tricky, both for me and maybe for you to grade. Question 1 and 3 were written in Python, but Question 2 is cumbersome to translate to python, so that's written with Matlab based on the example code. Each sub question was organized in a separate folder. within each sub question folder, you could ignore all other files except bbm*.m (wildcard matching) and main.m(the main driver function to trigger bbm*.m files). each bbm*.m file contains the codes to fulfill each sub question. Comments and observations regarding each question is scattered in main.m. Explanation on code is within bbm*.m file. 

Question 1 and 3 are written in jupyter notebook, homework5.ipynb, with comments and observations shown where they needs to be. 

thanks for this quarter! 

regards,

zhenyang
